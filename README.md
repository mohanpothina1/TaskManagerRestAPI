# TaskManagerRestAPI
This project implements a Task Manager backend RESTful API using Spring Boot and MongoDB. It allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on tasks stored in a MongoDB database. The API endpoints enable seamless task management with features like task creation, retrieval, updating specific fields, and deletion.
